# VLC_auto_player
Using VLC and image-recognizing modules, you can now automatically reproduce songs or videos in text files (.txt) and make playlists with links.
It only works (for now) on 1920x1080 monitors. If yours is not in that resolution, please let me know!

It works on Windows and Linux, all the instructions are in the code.

You can execute it in bash terminal / Linux terminals by using the .sh files (bash files) in the folder, which execute the python core programs.

## Now, you can reproduce files of types such as mp3, mp4, avi... with file_auto_player().

# The latest feature is that you can now put any file or url, or even text files with files and links, in any_auto_player().

The first version was made on 16/Dec/2023.

# The last version, unless a major implementation is possible, is the one made on 17/Dec/2023.
