# VLC_auto_player
Using VLC and image-recognizing modules, you can now automatically reproduce songs or videos in text files (.txt) and make playlists with links.
It only works (for now) on 1920x1080 monitors. If yours is not in that resolution, please let me know!
It only works on Windows and Linux, all the instructions are in the code.
The first version was made on 16/Dec/2023.
